Java Numbers
===========
I created this class to explore some of my recent investigations and research on the trouble with doubles & precision in the Java language.  This was done in part to justify my move to the BigDecimal data type.

Sample Output
-------------
    a: 1.0
    b: 0.35
    c: 0.65
    d: 0.35
    e: 0.035
    f: 0.034999999999999996
    g: 0.06999999999999999
    0.70 * 0.05 * 2.0 != 0.07
